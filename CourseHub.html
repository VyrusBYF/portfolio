                            CourseHub is a course recommendation tool that allows students to make informed choices when
                            choosing free electives. These electives make up the remaining credit requirements
                            associated with a degree programme and can be chosen from any available field of study at
                            the university. The app was designed with the intended integration of the University of the
                            West Indies' student administration system.

                            Recommender systems are information filtering systems that operate on the preferences or
                            item ratings of a given user(s). The system utilizes user behavior and historical data to
                            predict an item that a given user might like. This is based on the similarity between the
                            choices or the similarities among the user and other users in the system.

                            The application utilizes content-based filtering as a recommendation method. This involves
                            the comparison of an item's features within the system and aspects of a given user(s) in
                            order to determine results that fit with the user's profile.
